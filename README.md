## 🎬 What is Pixel Pig?  
Pixel Pig is a standalone desktop app for Windows and macOS that helps you generate, organise, and manage AI‑generated assets through a consistent workflow—no matter which API provider you use.  

Supports multiple API aggregators including **Fal**, **Replicate**, and **Kie.ai**, with more added based on community interest.  
Early support is also available for connecting to local **ComfyUI** instances for text‑to‑image batching and remote connections.  

Pixel Pig supports a wide range of AI workflows for creating and editing images, videos, voice, sound effects, lip‑sync, and 3D assets.  

- Simple batch operations — run multiple models and aspect ratios in just a few clicks  
- No manual uploads or downloads — everything’s handled automatically  
- Built‑in tools for file viewing, frame extraction, cropping, colour adjustment, format conversion, and batch management  
- Flexible Prompt Builder — customise categories of snippets, save favourites, and tag prompts for quick access

1. Download the ZIP for your platform from the **Releases** tab.  
2. Unzip it wherever you like, then run the executable (Windows) or app bundle (macOS).  
3. The app is not signed, so you’ll need to allow it to run manually. A helper script and instructions are included for macOS.  
4. Use it in your workflow and see how it fits.  
5. Found a bug or something odd? [Open an issue](../../issues).

**What’s next**  
- User‑added models — definitions shared here on GitHub  
- Custom workflow presets — save and share  
- Pipelines — chain workflows for complex runs in one go  

*(Nightly builds can be made available if there’s interest.)*
