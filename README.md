## 🎬 What is Pixel Pig?  
Pixel Pig is a standalone desktop app for Windows and macOS that helps you generate, organise, and manage AI-generated assets through a consistent workflow — no matter which API provider you use.  

It supports multiple API aggregators including **Fal**, **Replicate**, and **Kie.ai**, with more added based on community interest.  
Early support is also available for connecting to local **ComfyUI** instances for text-to-image batching and remote connections.  

Pixel Pig supports a wide range of AI workflows for creating and editing images, videos, voice, sound effects, lip-sync, and 3D assets.

Models that rank highly on public leaderboards are included out of the box, and **community model mappings** are supported so you can extend what’s available.

- Simple batch operations — run multiple models and aspect ratios in just a few clicks  
- No manual uploads or downloads — everything’s handled automatically  
- Built-in tools for file viewing, frame extraction, cropping, colour adjustment, format conversion, and batch management  
- Flexible Prompt Builder — customise categories of snippets, save favourites, and tag prompts for quick access
